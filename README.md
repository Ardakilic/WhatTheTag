Hey all,

Here's my latest project that came out using [Laravel 5](https://www.laravel.com). This is called **WhatTheTag**.

##Why?

There are some reasons behind this project.

* Firstly, I needed this. I didn't like Picasa's web interface, and I wanted to make a simple website that I could search my photos (actually my "*internet meme folder*") efficiently.
* I wanted to play with Laravel 5 and to make a sample application that uses various features of Laravel 5.
* I also wanted to play with some asset management tools such as [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

After deciding to make this app, it took maybe a week or so in my spare times to pull this application together.

##Features

* This application's main feature is to upload, tag, list and search photos, so you can access to your photos easier.
* There is multi account support, also there are two roles of users called **user** and **admin**.
* All assets are handled using `gulp`. You just need to add or edit the assets in `resources` folder. Afterwards, all of the assets are compiled, merged, minified and copied into their own folders in `public` directory. I specifically didn't use Laravel Elixir, because I think using this way it's more flexible.
* The app shows **Random Photos** in the main page
* You can list **Recent Photos** from the navigation menu called Recent Photos.
* You can make a **search**. This feature searches in Photo's title, Photo's uploader's name and in the tags that are attached to the photo. You may assume this is sort of a global search.
* There are also pages such as "**user's uploaded photos**", "**all photos tagged with xx**".
* You can **preview** the photos in a Bootstrap modal, and **download directly**.
* There is also a **photo details page**. In this page there are **Disqus comments**, and **social buttons**.
* In **administration panel**, while uploading / editing a photo, **you may also fetch the EXIF data of a photo directly and add them into the tags**. So let's say you've already tagged a photo before. If it's tagged normally, the system gets the tags and adds them into the tags list of the photo.
* You can also preview the photo before uploading.

##Requirements

* [Laravel 5.0's server requirements](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/installation#server-requirements),
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to install 3rd party dependencies,
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) Required for [gulp-ruby-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-ruby-sass),
* [Sass >= 3.4](http://sass-lang.com/install) Required for [gulp-ruby-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-ruby-sass). You can check it by running `sass --version` from your terminal.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install frontend dependencies,
* [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to compile assets.

##Installation

* First, clone the repository into your server

```shell
https://github.com/Ardakilic/WhatTheTag.git

```

* Secondly, install dependencies

```shell
composer install
npm install
```

Alternatively, you can also update dependencies with

```shell
composer update
npm update
```

* Thirdly, compile and install assets

```shell
gulp clean
gulp
```

* Now, create an `.env` file and fill your database credentials. You can copy it from `.env.example` file as a template.

* Now, install the database schema from migration, and seed the users table for the administrator user:

```
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

* Now, edit the app-specific configuration files found in `config/whatthetag.php`:

	* `site_name` defines the site's name (will be shown in the title etc.).
	* `twitter_name` will fill the "shared via" section on Twitter share button.
	* `comments_enabled` will enable or disable the comments section in the site. The value is boolean, so set it `false` to disable comments.
	* `disqus_identifier` is your unique identifier in your Disqus panel. You can create a new identifier for your website by [following this link](https://disqus.com/admin/create/)

* Make sure the `/public/uploads/` folder is writable.

* Now, simply run the application. You can create a new virtualhost either from Apache, or Nginx etc.
	
	**Note:** PHP's own web server (e.g. if you're running it with `php artisan serve`) will give 404 erros in administration panel, because Datatables's AJAX links are quite long, and it gives 404 errors on very long links unless you edit this setting.
	
* Now you can login into your application.

	Default username is `admin@whatthetag.com`
	The default password is `whatthetag`
	
	*Don't forget to change these after logging in!*

* Now, simply navigate through your app and enjoy! :smile:

##Digging the Code?
Well, you should do this!

Why you may ask. Because one of the reasons of this app is to make a sample application using Laravel 5.

This application covers:

* Simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Laravel 5.
* Eloquent Relationships. You can see live examples of BelongsTo, HasMany, BelongsToMany relationships in this app.
* All the contents are accessed using slugs. Managing slugs are handled with a 3rd party package.
* Listing content dynamically using Datatables in Administration Panel with a 3rd party package.
* Example usage of Masterpages for views.
* Downloading popular assets (jQuery, Bootstrap, FontAwesome etc.) from npm repositories, compile and merge them with application's own assets.
* Handling file uploads and processing them.
* Reading EXIF data from an uploaded image using PHP.
* Has an authentication system, and role-based access middlewares.

##Thanks

* [Koding](https://koding.com/R/arda), all of the project is written on the cloud on Koding's servers directly from my browser. You must definitely try the service, also it's free!
* [Burak Can](https://twitter.com/neoberg) and [Eser Ã–zvataf](http://eser.ozvataf.com/) for their ideas especially while handling assets.
